This is a repository for my notable coursework and major projects that I've completed throughout my university career. Some of these projects were completed at the University of Utah Computer Science program, and some of them were completed at Boise State University Computer Science program. Each directory is  for either a notable course, or a major project. Below is a table of contents, and each directory also has its own README with information on what it is and how to build it.
